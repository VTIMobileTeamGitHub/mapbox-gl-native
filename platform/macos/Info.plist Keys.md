# Info.plist Keys

The Mapbox macOS SDK supports custom `Info.plist` keys in your application in order to configure various settings. 

## MGLMapboxAccessToken

Use this key to set your Mapbox API [access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-access-token/). This key is required for all map use. 

## MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL

Use this key if you need to customize the API base URL used throughout the SDK. If unset, the default Mapbox API is used.
